# Epidemic Simulation

This Python script simulates the spread of an epidemic within a population using the Pygame library. Individuals move around a defined area, interact with each other, and can become infected based on certain probabilities. The simulation allows users to intervene by applying vaccines or masks to individuals.

## Usage 

1. Run the simulation script:

    ```
    python epidemic_simulation.py
    ```

2. Interact with the simulation:
    - **Spacebar**: Pause/unpause the simulation.
    - **Left Click**: Apply vaccine to an individual.
    - **Right Click**: Apply mask to an individual.
    - **Close Button**: Exit the simulation.

3. Observe the simulation:
    - Individuals move around and interact with each other.
    - Active cases, time, and budget are displayed on the screen.
    - Colors indicate the state of individuals: clear (uninfected), infected, immune, and masked.

4. Experiment with different parameters in the script to explore various scenarios.

## Configuration
Constants such as population size, infection rate, person speed, colors, etc., can be adjusted in the script according to specific requirements.
